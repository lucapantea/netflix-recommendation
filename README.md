### Movie rating prediction
#### Data Mining (CSE2525) 2020-2021
The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation algorithm for movies. The data for this project comprises 910,190 ratings (on a 1 to 5 scale) that were given by 6,040 users to 3,706 movies. Next to the ratings, the data contains some information on the users (gender, age, and profession) and information on the movies (title and year of release). We develop an algorithm that, based on this data, predicts as good as possible what rating a particular user will give to a particular movie.
